My initial interest in reading this book came from a recommendation by C.S. Joseph (to INTJ).

Although the book is interesting, I personally do not enjoy reading biblical literature. I found it difficult to continue reading because the ideology does not align with my own beliefs, which are completely different. As a result, I decided to quit reading the KJV Bible, which I had started with the intention of understanding what Christians believe. It doesn’t worth my time.

By 2023, I had read about one-sixth of the book, but ultimately decided not to finish it. To say the least, reading a biblical book did not appeal to me, as it seemed full of BS. This book is about the Third Gospel of God, and Viola encourages the reader to see and appreciate Jesus and the Lord's beauty, and to cultivate a feeling of love and admiration for Him deep in the heart.

Although this book was not for me, I would highly recommend it to any Christian or biblical scholar. I believe that it would be of great interest and value to anyone who is looking to deepen their understanding of their faith, and who is open to exploring different perspectives on their beliefs. Additionally, I think that this book could be an excellent resource for anyone who is interested in learning more about the history and context of Christianity, and how it has evolved over time.

简单来说，这种书实在不符合我认同的观念，故而不读了。
