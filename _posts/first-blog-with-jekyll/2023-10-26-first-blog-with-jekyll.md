Hello, this is my first ever blog with Jekyll.

I have used to blog with blogspot, then tried wordpress and substack for blogging. However the complication comes with such platform is not suitable for me. Therefore from now on, I will start to blog onmy own website with Jekyll.

#### my past blogging journey

I used to spent lots of time (way too much) at finding a template for blogspot and wordpress that is free and of my preference, but they all does not feel right. So I decide to move to substack, it didn't quiet suit me either after a while.

Later I thought to myself, why don't I just blog on my own website on Github, oh dear it was such a hasssle to get it too work, for some reason the codes Icommit does not push to the origin and spent way too much time dealing with the prerequisize to download and etc.

I stumble upon this lovely keyell theme called [Klise Theme](https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise), which the author on the github page has linked button to deploy on netlify or azure or vercel. it ended my struggle to find a good template.

#### future blogging

I know there is hardly going to be any audience for my little personal blog since it is only associated with my [mastodon account](https://mast.dragon-fly.club/@kirilina), but if you ever accidently or intentionally find this blog here, that means it is very fortunate to have you here.
