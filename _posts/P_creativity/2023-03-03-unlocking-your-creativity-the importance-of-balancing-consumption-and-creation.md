Do you find yourself scrolling on social media or watching YouTube videos more often than you would like? Instead of getting lost in the ocean of content, there is something even more exciting: creating something unique and valuable.

During my free time, I particularly enjoy reading books and listening to music. In all forms of media, it is a pleasure to "consume" their creations. I take inspiration from other creators' work and am working on my own projects.

I believe the transformation from "consumer" to "creator" is a significant mindset shift. By thinking as both a consumer and creator, it allows you to appreciate the work of others while learning from it and using that knowledge to create something unique yourself.

Recently, I have been reading the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. I found his writing style elegant and interesting. I am determined to improve my writing and focus on the perspicuity of writing. This is where I will practice my writing skills through blogging here.

Throughout history, some of the greatest idea or invention are built upon work of the predecessors, the ladder of knowledge is how everything has advanced to the present. Engaging in both consumption and creation can lead to a better comprehension and appreciation of the creative process.

It is crucial to analyse what you enjoy about the content you consume (on a subconscious level), such as when listening to music: What makes that music so enjoyable, the melody, the drop, or the feeling it gives you? It is essential to understand what makes good content when creating your own work. By all means, enjoy the content, but don't just passively intake it.

By exposing yourself to a diverse range of content and really think about what you enjoy about them, you can gain insights into what makes compelling content that captures the reader's imagination and use that knowledge to create something unique and valuable. Create something or share your own ideas and perspectives to the world! I believe everyone has a "creator dream," adding to the collective knowledge and creativity of humanity as a whole.

As a quick aside, the concept of consumer and creator is somewhat linked to religious beliefs about God and creation. It is really interesting to think from this perspective. In this contextual framework, humans are often viewed as both consumers and creators, as we consume our environment and use our knowledge, skills, and creativity to shape it in various ways suited for us.

As we are in the age of information, which is more accessible and perhaps more addictive, people are consuming more content than creating it. As a result, this has led to a pattern of consumption where we spend hours scrolling through social media feeds or binge-watching shows without ever creating anything ourselves. While consuming content can be enjoyable and educational, overconsumption can negatively impact your creativity and productivity.

Finding a balance between consumption and creation involves shifting our mindset from that of a passive consumer to an active creator. This means taking responsibility for our own experiences and actively seeking out opportunities to create, this can be incredibly fulfilling and can help us develop new skills and insights, whether it's through writing, drawing, music, or other creative endeavour, which I have start to practise routinely.

Make time for yourself every day to create instead of consume, this is beneficial to have a fulfilling life.

I strongly encourage you to take responsibility for your own experiences and actively seek out opportunities to create, embrace your creativity and use it to make something you're passionate about.
