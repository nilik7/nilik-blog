After watching a video on inlfation rate a while back, I tried to use do my own calculation to find inflation rate as advised by the video:

                                                    M2 growth rate - GDP growth rate = inflation rate

Which proved unsucceful after attempting, I also used M1 and M3 data to to see if the calculated inflation rate matched with the offically publsihed CPI or CPHI rate.

The spreadsheet I made is free for download and discussion. I might com back to this problem in the furture.
