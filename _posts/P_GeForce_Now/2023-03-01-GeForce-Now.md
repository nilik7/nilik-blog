For a while now, I've been hearing about cloud gaming and how it's the future for gaming. I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I mostly play on my phone because my laptop isn't good enough for more demanding games. In the past, I've tried playing Genshin Impact and Albion Online on my old ThinkPad, but it's not very pleasant because the laptop gets hot and the fan is loud. So, I decided to try cloud gaming and I was really impressed.



GeForce Now Homepage

I tried out one of the best cloud gaming services called GeForce Now. They have a free version that lets you play for one hour per session. The service is really fantastic with over 400 games available. As long as you have a good internet connection and a decent device, you're all set.

I was surprised that when I played League of Legends on GeForce Now, my laptop fan didn't even turn on! That's a big change from when I tried playing the game before. My computer also didn't use much power, which I could see by checking the memory and CPU usage. I was playing on a much better graphics card (GTX 1080) than my computer's built-in one (GeForce GT 730M).

I played League of Legends at about 60 frames per second (which is the limit for the free version). It was fine. For the first time, I could run League of Legends on my laptop without having to install it or have a high-spec laptop. I also didn't need to take up space on my computer to store the game. The download speed was also much faster.



Huge lag during game

To actively monitor my FPS and ping, I opened the GeForce Now Statistics during my gameplay as it provides more accurate information than what's shown in the game. Most of the time it is really stable, however, when internet connection is spotty, the game can get laggy and the graphics can be blurry. You can fix this by connecting your device directly to the router with an Ethernet cable. Another downside is the need to keep track of my playtime, usually, I can only play one League of Legends match per session, two would be too much of a stretch for one hour.



Stable LOL Game-play

I highly recommend trying out GeForce Now, it's an outstanding service that exceeded my expectations. With GeForce Now, I can play high-performance games on cloud servers that surpass my laptop's capabilities. For anyone looking to explore cloud gaming, I strongly suggest giving GeForce Now a try, it's worth it!
