一道概率题。已知个体患某罕见病的概率为5.1/10万, 在已知某总人数不到20人的实验组内至少三人同时同期确诊该罕见病的前提下，求患该罕见病与实验组无关联的概率？
A probability question. Given that the probability of an individual developing a rare disease is 5.1/100,000, what is the probability that the rare disease is not associated with the experimental group, provided that at least three individuals in the group of less than 20 are diagnosed with the disease at the same time?
