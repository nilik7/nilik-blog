### Oxbridge Interviews
- What tutors are looking for:
  - Academic ability and potential
  - Flexibility of thought and responsiveness
  - Enthusiastic engagement with new ideas
- Remember:
  - It is not necessarily about always getting the right answers. Vocalising throught processes is important - explain the thinking behind ideas. If you're not sure, take a sensible guess. Ask questions if you're not sure. Remember to discuss and collaborate. It is absolutely ok to say "I don't know". Try to explainwhat you DO know about the question.

### Interview Preparation
- Read your personal statement again and any written work you had to submit.
- Explore your subject beyond what you've learnt at school: read books, watch videos and listen to podcasts.
- Think about topics that are relevant to your subject, that interest you and that you might like to talk about.
- Practise talking about your subject with friends/family/teachers.
- Have a practice interview: ideally ask a teacher or someone who doesn't know you well so that you can practise expressing your ideas and opinions. Alternatively you could ask yourself questions for half an hour. This will help you to get used to talking about yourself, your work and thinking in a critical way.
- If you've applied for an <u>arts, humanities or social sciences</u> course it's useful for:
  - read more than the texts set by your school, sixth form or college
  - analyuse what you've read and think critically about it
- If you've applied for a <u>maths or science</u> course it's useful to:
  - practise problem solving
  - think about how you might show or explain the way you worked out a problem
  - read more about your subjectand focus on parts that particularly interest you.
