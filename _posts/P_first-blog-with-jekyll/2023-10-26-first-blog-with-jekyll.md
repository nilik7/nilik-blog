#### Welcome to My first Blog with Jekyll

Greetings! This marks my inaugural blog post using Jekyll. In the past, I've explored blogging on platforms like Blogspot, WordPress, and Substack. However, I found these platforms to be quite complicated and not entirely suitable for my needs. As a result, I've decided to embark on my blogging journey on my very own website with Jekyll.

#### Reflecting on My Past Blogging Experience
I spent a significant amount of time searching for free templates on Blogspot and WordPress that matched my preferences, but none of them felt quite right. Substack seemed promising initially, but it didn't fully meet my requirements either. Frustrated, I contemplated hosting my blog on my GitHub page. However, this endeavor proved to be quite challenging. I encountered issues with code commits not pushing to the origin repository, and I wasted considerable time dealing with prerequisites and downloads.

Luckily, my perseverance led me to the [Klise Theme](https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise) on GitHub, which turned out to be a lifesaver. The theme came with deployment buttons for platforms like Netlify, Azure, and Vercel, putting an end to my struggle in finding a suitable template.

#### Looking Ahead: The Future of My Blog

I am aware that my personal blog might not attract a large audience, given its connection solely to my [Mastodon account](https://mast.dragon-fly.club/@kirilina). However, if you've stumbled upon this blog, either accidentally or intentionally, consider it a stroke of luck. I genuinely appreciate your presence here.

Feel free to subscribe to the RSS feed or connect with me on [Mastodon](https://mast.dragon-fly.club/@kirilina). Your support means the world to me, and I look forward to sharing more content with you in the future. Thank you for being here!
